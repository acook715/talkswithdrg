The Elmhurst College Center for Professional Excellence is hosting a workshop around AI and the Future of Jobs. The goal of workshop is to discuss:
1.	What is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning and its relationship to the labor market?
2.	What will the near and long term impact of this technology be on jobs?
3.	How should/could you advise your students/clients to effectively navigate the new jobs landscape effectively using knowledge about technology like ATS?
